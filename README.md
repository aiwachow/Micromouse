# Micromouse 2.0 class robot 
Micromouse is a autonomous robot whose purpose is to drive through the maze in the shortest time. 
This design include microcontrollers like STM32 and ESP32. Esp was added to testing over-the-air update  
and wireless communication for STM32. Walls are detecting by IR diodes and phototransistors.

## Things that have been tested and work:
- [x] Hardware 
- [x] STM32, flashing via ST-LINK  
- [x] Dc motors (with driver)
- [x] Encoders 
- [x] Proximity sensor 
- [ ] ESP32

## Software 

In the future, there will be a description of two approaches to the robot's software, as two two-person teams are working on the project.
